            <h3> The Golden Notebook by Doris Lessing</h3>
              <p>
              Anna is a writer, author of one very successful novel, who now keeps four notebooks. In one, with a black cover, she reviews the African experience of her earlier year. In a red one she records her political life, her disillusionment with communism. In a yellow one she writes a novel in which the heroine reviles part of her own experience.

            <h3> Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace </h3>
              <p>
              A gargantuan, mind-altering comedy about the Pursuit of Happiness in America.
              </p>

              <p>
              Set in an addicts' halfway house and a tennis academy, and featuring the most endearingly screwed-up family to come along in recent fiction, Infinite Jest explores essential questions about what entertainment is and why it has come to so dominate our lives.

            <h3> All About Love: New Visions (Love Trilogy) by Bell Hooks </h3>
              <p>
              All About Love offers radical new ways to think about love by showing its interconnectedness in our private and public lives. In eleven concise chapters, hooks explains how our everyday notions of what it means to give and receive love often fail us.
